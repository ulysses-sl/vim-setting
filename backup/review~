How should agent act when

...goal is not immediate?
-search
-A*
-heuristics

...in presence of other agents?
-expectimax, minimax, non-zero sum game

...when the actions are non-deterministic?
-MDPs

... when the state of the world is uncertain?
but you know how it is uncertain(i.e. you have model)
-probabilistic reasoning
-BNets, HMMs
-Inference, VE, filtering, approximate

...how can agent exploit structure of problem?
-CSP, BNs  -  state = assignment ot set of variables
              limited interactions between variables
              CSPs = hard constraints
              BNs = soft constraints

...what if agent is uncertain about how the world works?
-Reinforcement learning  -  learning from experience
-Machine learning  -  DT, NB, Perceptron, MIRA, theory
