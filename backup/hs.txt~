Backtracking sudoku solver written in Chicken Scheme 4.8, due to some bugs the program works half of the time and does not half of the time if it is above moderate difficulty (probably in backtracking search), but I did not get to work on it since the beginning of semester.

Can I pick three? I can't choose one: threading, monad, bit manipulation. I learned about various ways to enforce cooperation among threads using mutex, conditional variables, and semaphore. I honestly have not dealt with multithreading algorithms for my a year-and-half experience in programming, so it was an eye-opening topic. Then there's monad; I was familiar with impure functional languages like Scheme (which already has shaken me thoroughly with SICP), and I did not see a practical use for purely functional languages, but learning how to use monad made me open to even newer modes of thinking. Finally, bitmaps and manipulation techniques (such as bit on-off, bit count, binary search on bitmaps, etc.) are simply so fun aside from being immensely useful.

I want to work as a software developer, but I want to work in an environment where I build things that are exciting and relevant I'm not sure I can work for startups around two-year line from now due to my visa status, but before or after that I would love to.

My time here at school does not allow much time for making the relevant stuff. What I learn now mostly are purely academic discrete math theory (since I already took algorithm). The CS department even explicitly warned me not to do any side project when I am taking 4 CS courses. I want to have some time for myself right after graduation(May 19th) to work on some practical projects using what I learned to get deeper understanding, and to prepare myself for real-life software development industry.

I would like to work on functional programming and machine learning.
