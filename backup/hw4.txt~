#1
Average turnaround is 47.107
Average wait time is 13.571


#2
Job length:
53,36,35,36,14,15,26,22,16,32,15,21,14,17,21,15,54,17,36,72,60,39,17,12,34,160,39,11

FIFO Average -- Response: 393.86  Turnaround 427.39  Wait 393.86
SJF  Average -- Response: 278.11  Turnaround 311.64  Wait 278.11
RR   Average -- Response: 135.00  Turnaround 584.93  Wait 551.39

SJF had both the lowest turnaround and wait time. It could be used for some extents (e.g. quick questions takes the shortest time, and making smoothies takes the longest time) but 1) otherwise job length is unpredictable in real life, and 2) unless the longer job can be suspended for the shorter job that arrived later(which is not exactly SJF), it would not perform ideally.


#3
When all job lengths are the same, it has the same turnaround time. Also, if the job arrives sorted by length, it is also the same.


#4
-When all job lengths are the same
-When quantum is longer than the longest job


#5
Jobs can pile up on a certain line while leaving others empty. Some cashier may finish scheduled job earlier, but the other cashier cannot have customers rescheduled to that cashier, effectively decreasing the number of cashier.


#6
Waiting increases since everyone is waiting on a same line but turnaround is better since jobs are more evenly distributed(?)


#7
a. While all 11 tasks are worked on for 1ms for once, the total is 11ms work + 1.1ms context switch. 11/12.1 = 0.91
b. While all 11 tasks are worked on for at most 10ms for once, the total is 21ms work + 1.1ms context switch. 21/22.1 = 0.95
