5. 

if not iterR.hasNext():
    return null
else:
    while iterR.hasNext() and t does not matches predicate:
        t = iterR.next()
    rv = t
    if iterR.hasNext():
        t = iterR.next()
    return rv

6.

list = []
while iterR.hasNext():
    while iterS.hasNext():
        t1 = iterR.next()
        t2 = iterS.next()
        if t1 and t2 match join predicate:
            list.append( merge(t1, t2) )
    iterS.rewind()
return list

7.

if not iterR.hasNext() and not iterS.hasNext():
    return null
else:
    while ( iterR.hasNext() or iterS.hasNext() ) and t1 and t2 does not match join predicate:
        if not iterS.hasNext():
            iterS.rewind()
            t1 = iterR.next()
        t2 = iterS.next()

    if t1 and t2 match join predicate:
